# School Anti-Block
This is a very small batch (.bat) program, designed for Windows, to continuously kill school filter and monitoring software's.
This right now only includes LightSpeed System's, but I have plans in the future to add more such as Dyknow.
I also plan to add in a user interface and make it over all more user friendly.
I suggest you to change the name of the batch file in case your administrators get suspicious and check your computer files.
